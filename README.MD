# 3Q-SDN Wordpress-Plugin

The 3QSDN-Plugin for Wordpress interates a button to the Wordpress TinyMCE-editor, which opens the media-library from 3Q-SDN.
Within the media-library the user can choose the desired video to include it to his Wordpress- Blog- or Page content.

## Installation
To install the Plugin you have multiple choices:
1. Copy the complete folder 3q-videos into your plugins folder, than go to your backend and activate the plugin.
2. Go to your Wordpress-Backend -> Plugins and click "upload Plugins" - select the zipped plugin-file and upload it. 
Now you ll find the Plugin "3Q" under your installed plugins. Activate it!

!! For all Wordpress Versions >=5.0 you have to install and activate the plugin "Classic-Editor", to be able to use the 3Q-plugin !!

## Current Plugin Status
1. The Plugin is tested on Versions <5.0 and works with the TinyMCE-editor.
2. The Plugin is currently in review from the wordpress-team.
3. With the new Version >=5.00 they introduced a new content-editor and deactivated the WYSYWIG-editor.
So this Plugin will not work with all Versions >=5.0 without installing the additional Plugin "Classic Editor".
The Classic-Editor will be maintained and supported until 2021.
